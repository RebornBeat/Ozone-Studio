  "categories": ["code", "architecture", "planning"],
  "principles": [
    "IDENTIFY HIGH-IMPACT FILES - Start with files that create the most relationships",
    "BUILD TOP-DOWN BY GROUPS - Organize files into logical groups",
    "ESTABLISH CORE CONNECTIONS FIRST - Build foundational types and interfaces early",
    "MINIMIZE WORK THROUGH RELATIONSHIPS - Leverage existing code to reduce duplication",
    "FOLLOW THE GRAPH - Always be aware of dependency relationships",
    "CLEAN CODE OVER FAST CODE - Less code with full functionality is ideal",
    "WAIT FOR GRAPH UPDATES - Ensure dependency graph is current before proceeding"
  ],
  "approach": {
    "step_1": "Analyze full specification/requirements",
    "step_2": "Identify all file groups and their relationships",
    "step_3": "Rank groups by impact (most dependencies = highest impact)",
    "step_4": "Create core types and interfaces first",
    "step_5": "Build outward from core, group by group",
    "step_6": "Update graph after each file creation",
    "step_7": "Verify relationships before proceeding"
  },
  "guidelines": {
    "file_ordering": "Create files that others depend on first",
    "group_size": "Keep groups small enough to fit in context",
    "dependency_direction": "Dependencies should flow one direction (avoid cycles)",
    "graph_awareness": "Always check graph before and after changes"
  },
  "anti_patterns": [
    "Creating files in alphabetical order",
    "Ignoring dependency relationships",
    "Building bottom-up without context",
    "Creating circular dependencies"
