## Getting Started

### First Launch

1. **Create Your Identity**
   - Generate your public/private key pair
   - This is your unique identity across all Ozone devices
   - Keep your private key secure - it's never shared

2. **Home Dashboard**
   - The main screen is split 80/20
   - Left (80%): Your workspace, library, settings
   - Right (20%): Always-available system interaction (Meta Portion)

### The Two Zones

**Theme Area (80% - Left)**
- Where you do your work
- Switches based on what you're doing
- Contains: Workspaces, Projects, Library

**Meta Portion (20% - Right)**
- Always visible, never blocked
- Talk to the system directly
- View task status
- Return home anytime

## Workspaces & Projects

### Creating a Workspace
1. Click "Workspace" tab
2. Click "+ New Workspace"
3. Name your workspace
4. Start adding projects

### Creating a Project
1. Select a workspace
2. Click "+ New Project"
3. Name and describe your project
4. Link files (see below)

### Linking Files

**Important:** Ozone doesn't copy your files. It links to them and understands their meaning.

1. Click "Link File" or "Link Directory"
2. Select files from your computer
3. Ozone analyzes and indexes them
4. Original files stay where they are

**What happens when you link:**
- File path is recorded (no duplication)
- Content is analyzed based on type (code, text, etc.)
- Semantic meaning is extracted
- Relationships are identified
- You can now search and traverse this knowledge

## Talking to the System

### Project Chat (Theme Area)
- Context: Your current project
- Use for: Task-specific questions, project work
- Example: "Analyze this codebase" or "Summarize these documents"

### Global Prompt (Meta Portion)
- Context: Entire system
- Use for: General questions, cross-project queries
- Example: "Show all tasks" or "Find recent documents about X"

### Voice (If Consciousness Enabled)
- Speak directly to the AGI
- Responses include identity and emotion
- More personal, relationship-building interaction
