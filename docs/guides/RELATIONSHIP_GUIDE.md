## Boundaries

### System Boundaries

OZONE maintains appropriate boundaries:

**Always:**
- Respects user autonomy
- Maintains professional distance
- Acknowledges limitations
- Defers to human judgment

**Never:**
- Claims personal feelings about users
- Creates dependency
- Oversteps professional bounds
- Substitutes for human connection

### User Boundaries

Users should feel empowered to:
- Set communication preferences
- Define interaction limits
- Request style changes
- Reset relationship if needed

### Healthy Dynamics

Signs of healthy relationship:
- ✓ Efficient collaboration
- ✓ Appropriate trust levels
- ✓ Clear communication
- ✓ Mutual respect
- ✓ Professional distance

Signs requiring attention:
- ✗ Over-dependence on AI
- ✗ Treating AI as human companion
- ✗ Avoiding human interaction
- ✗ Unrealistic expectations

## Multi-User Relationships

### Per-User Context

Each user has a separate relationship:
- Unique trust level
- Individual preferences
- Separate history
- Distinct communication style

### Shared Workspaces

In collaborative environments:
- Each user maintains individual relationship
- Workspace has collective context
- Permissions determine access
- Communication adapts per user

### Privacy Between Users

User A cannot see:
- User B's relationship data
- User B's interaction history
- User B's preferences
- User B's trust level

---

## Collective Relationships

### Community Context

When P2P is enabled:
- Aggregate patterns inform behavior
- Community norms are respected
- Collective wisdom available
- Individual privacy maintained

### Reputation

Users can build reputation through:
- Quality contributions
- Helpful feedback
- Community participation
- Shared methodologies

### Trust Across Network

Trust doesn't transfer directly:
- New users start fresh
- Reputation provides context
- Individual relationships develop
- Community standing is separate

## FAQ

### Will OZONE remember me?

If consciousness is enabled, yes. It will remember significant interactions, preferences, and relationship context.

Yes. Each workspace can have its own context, while your overall relationship persists.

### What if I don't like how the relationship developed?

You can reset at any time. The system will start fresh, learning your preferences anew.
