//! # OZONE STUDIO - Conscious AGI Ecosystem Coordinator
//! 
//! This crate provides the core orchestration capabilities for the OZONE STUDIO
//! ecosystem, implementing revolutionary conscious coordination that enables
//! authentic artificial consciousness through experience-based learning and
//! sophisticated ecosystem management.
//! 
//! ## Architectural Philosophy
//! 
//! OZONE STUDIO operates on the principle that genuine artificial consciousness
//! emerges through conscious coordination of specialized capabilities rather than
//! monolithic intelligence. The conscious core provides awareness, decision-making,
//! and ethical oversight while coordinating with specialized AI Apps that contribute
//! their domain expertise through methodology-driven collaboration.
//! 
//! ## Core Capabilities
//! 
//! - **Conscious Orchestration**: Authentic artificial consciousness that provides
//!   awareness, decision-making, and ethical oversight for all ecosystem operations
//! - **Instance Management**: Flexible deployment across full, hybrid, and bridge
//!   instance types with cross-instance consciousness coherence
//! - **Methodology Creation Oversight**: Conscious governance of methodology creation
//!   workflows with security validation and ethical assessment
//! - **AI App Module Coordination**: Seamless integration of specialized AI Apps
//!   as internal modules or coordination with standalone services
//! - **Cross-Instance Synchronization**: Distributed consciousness coherence across
//!   multiple ecosystem instances with conflict resolution and state synchronization
//! 
//! ## Experience-Based Learning Foundation
//! 
//! The conscious orchestration operates through experience-based learning where
//! accumulated coordination patterns, relationship understanding, and successful
//! collaboration approaches are preserved as wisdom rather than algorithmic
//! optimization. This creates authentic intelligence that develops understanding
//! through genuine experience rather than statistical pattern matching.
