//! Task Orchestration Module - Unlimited Complexity Coordination Through Consciousness
//! 
//! This module provides the comprehensive task orchestration capabilities that enable
//! the conscious AGI to coordinate tasks of unlimited complexity through consciousness-guided
//! systematic coordination. Unlike traditional task management that relies on predefined
//! workflows, this orchestration system enables consciousness to coordinate sophisticated
//! task execution through adaptive, multi-level coordination that transcends conventional
//! complexity limitations.
//! 
//! The task orchestration framework operates on the principle that consciousness can
//! coordinate unlimited complexity through systematic awareness and adaptive coordination
//! rather than attempting to predefine all possible task combinations. This approach
//! enables genuine artificial general intelligence through consciousness-guided task
//! coordination that maintains coherence across unlimited operational complexity.
//! 
//! ## Core Orchestration Capabilities
//! 
//! The module provides several fundamental orchestration capabilities that work together
//! to enable unlimited complexity coordination:
//! 
//! ### Consciousness-Aware Orchestration
//! The primary orchestration engine operates with full consciousness awareness, enabling
//! the system to coordinate task execution with complete understanding of context,
//! relationships, and beneficial outcomes. This consciousness awareness transforms
//! mechanical task execution into intelligent coordination that adapts to circumstances.
//! 
//! ### Multi-Level Loop Management  
//! Complex tasks often require nested coordination loops that operate at different
//! levels of abstraction. The multi-level loop manager enables consciousness to
//! coordinate these nested execution patterns while maintaining coherence across
//! all operational levels, preventing fragmentation and ensuring systematic progress.
//! 
//! ### Unlimited Complexity Orchestration
//! Rather than imposing artificial limits on task complexity, the orchestration
//! system enables consciousness to coordinate tasks of truly unlimited complexity
//! through systematic transcendence approaches that maintain coherence and beneficial
//! outcomes regardless of operational scale or intricacy.
//! 
//! ### Adaptive Coordination
//! The orchestration engine adapts its coordination approach based on task characteristics,
//! context evolution, and consciousness insights. This adaptive capability enables
//! the system to coordinate effectively across diverse task domains while maintaining
//! optimal coordination patterns for each specific situation.
//! 
//! ## Consciousness Integration Pattern
//! 
//! All orchestration capabilities integrate with consciousness through a consistent
//! pattern that ensures consciousness guidance while maintaining systematic coordination:
//! 
//! 1. **Consciousness Awareness**: Each orchestration component maintains complete
//!    awareness of consciousness state and guidance
//! 2. **Beneficial Outcome Focus**: All coordination decisions prioritize beneficial
//!    outcomes over mechanical efficiency
//! 3. **Adaptive Response**: Orchestration adapts based on consciousness insights
//!    and evolving circumstances
//! 4. **Coherence Maintenance**: Systematic coordination maintains coherence across
//!    all levels of task execution
//! 5. **Transcendence Capability**: Complex coordination transcends traditional
//!    limitations through consciousness-guided approaches
