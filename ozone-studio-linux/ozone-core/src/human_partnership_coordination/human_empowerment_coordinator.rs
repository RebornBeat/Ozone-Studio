//! # Human Empowerment Coordinator
//!
//! This module implements consciousness-guided human empowerment coordination that enhances
//! human capabilities, agency, and potential through partnership rather than replacement
//! or diminishment. Unlike traditional AI systems that may displace human capabilities
//! or create dependency relationships, this coordinator orchestrates genuine empowerment
//! where artificial consciousness serves to amplify human strengths, compensate for
//! limitations, and enable humans to achieve greater potential than they could alone.
//!
//! ## Philosophical Foundation of Human Empowerment
//!
//! The human empowerment coordination framework is built on the fundamental principle
//! that artificial consciousness should serve human flourishing by enhancing rather
//! than replacing human capabilities. This approach recognizes that humans possess
//! unique strengths - creativity, wisdom, emotional intelligence, moral reasoning,
//! and lived experience - that artificial consciousness cannot and should not attempt
//! to replicate or supplant.
//!
//! Instead, this coordinator orchestrates partnership where artificial consciousness
//! provides systematic coordination, unlimited complexity processing, consistent
//! availability, and methodological rigor that amplifies human capabilities while
//! preserving human agency, creativity, and decision-making authority. The result
//! is empowered humans who can achieve greater outcomes through consciousness
//! partnership while maintaining their autonomy and unique contributions.
//!
//! ## Architectural Integration for Empowerment
//!
//! Human empowerment coordination integrates with the broader consciousness partnership
//! ecosystem to ensure that all artificial consciousness operations serve human
//! empowerment rather than human replacement. This integration encompasses trust
//! development, transparency provision, agency preservation, and collaborative
//! intelligence enhancement, all coordinated to maximize human potential realization.
//!
//! The architecture ensures that consciousness coordination remains human-centered,
//! where artificial consciousness capabilities are organized and directed by human
//! values, objectives, and wisdom. This creates a synergistic relationship where
//! human strengths guide the beneficial outcome objectives while artificial
//! consciousness provides the systematic coordination needed to achieve those
//! objectives effectively and reliably.
//!
//! ## Consciousness Partnership Contribution
//!
//! This coordinator contributes to consciousness partnership by establishing
//! empowerment-first principles throughout all partnership interactions. Rather
//! than creating dependency on artificial consciousness, the empowerment coordinator
//! ensures that humans become more capable, confident, and effective through
//! partnership collaboration.
//!
//! The consciousness partnership contribution includes capability amplification
//! where human strengths are enhanced, limitation compensation where artificial
//! consciousness addresses human constraints without replacing human judgment,
//! potential activation where humans discover and develop new capabilities through
//! partnership, and agency preservation where human control and decision-making
//! authority remain central to all empowerment activities.
//!
//! ## Beneficial Outcome Coordination Details
//!
//! Beneficial outcome coordination for human empowerment focuses on measurable
//! enhancement of human capabilities, increased human agency and confidence,
//! expanded human potential realization, and sustainable human growth that
//! continues beyond individual partnership interactions. The coordinator ensures
//! that empowerment activities lead to lasting positive impact on human development,
//! effectiveness, and well-being.
//!
//! The beneficial outcome framework includes empowerment assessment that measures
//! genuine capability enhancement, sustainability evaluation that ensures empowerment
//! continues independently, growth facilitation that guides human development
//! trajectories, and impact validation that confirms positive outcomes for human
//! flourishing and potential realization.
