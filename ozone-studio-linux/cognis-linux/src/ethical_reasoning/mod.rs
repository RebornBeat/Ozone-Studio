// MODULE DOCUMENTATION
// =============================================================================

//! # COGNIS Ethical Reasoning Module
//! 
//! This module implements authentic ethical reasoning for COGNIS, enabling the development
//! of genuine moral understanding rather than rule-following behavior. The key insight is
//! that ethical behavior emerges from understanding *why* actions are right or wrong, not
//! just from following programmed rules.
//! 
//! ## Core Philosophy
//! 
//! Unlike traditional AI ethics approaches that rely on constraint satisfaction or utility
//! maximization, this module enables COGNIS to develop moral understanding through:
//! 
//! - **Experiential Learning**: Ethical principles develop through accumulated experience
//!   with moral situations, similar to how humans develop moral intuitions.
//! 
//! - **Meta-Ethical Reflection**: COGNIS doesn't just apply principles, but thinks about
//!   the principles themselves, their origins, limitations, and interactions.
//! 
//! - **Stakeholder-Centered Analysis**: Every ethical decision considers all affected
//!   parties, including their interests, vulnerabilities, and relationships with COGNIS.
//! 
//! - **Principled Flexibility**: While maintaining core ethical commitments, the system
//!   can adapt its reasoning to novel situations by understanding underlying principles.
//! 
//! ## Key Components
//! 
//! ### ReasoningCoordinator
//! Orchestrates the entire ethical reasoning process, from scenario analysis through
//! decision recommendation. This is the main entry point for ethical decision-making.
//! 
//! ### MetaSimulation  
//! Enables "thinking about thinking about ethics" - analyzing the quality of ethical
//! reasoning, detecting biases, and improving moral reasoning processes over time.
//! 
//! ### MoralDevelopment
//! Tracks how COGNIS's moral understanding evolves through experience, refining
//! principles and developing new moral insights through accumulated wisdom.
//! 
//! ### PrincipledDecisions
//! Applies ethical principles to specific scenarios, resolving conflicts between
//! competing moral claims while maintaining consistency with past decisions.
//! 
//! ## Ethical Development Process
//! 
//! 1. **Initial Principles**: COGNIS starts with basic ethical principles (harm
//!    prevention, respect for persons, fairness) that are refined through experience.
//! 
//! 2. **Experiential Refinement**: Each ethical decision provides learning data about
//!    how principles apply in practice and their interactions with context.
//! 
//! 3. **Meta-Reflection**: Regular analysis of reasoning quality and bias detection
//!    improves the moral reasoning process itself.
//! 
//! 4. **Principled Growth**: New moral insights emerge from the intersection of
//!    principles with novel situations, expanding ethical understanding.
//! 
//! 5. **Consistency Validation**: All ethical decisions are checked for consistency
//!    with past decisions and core principles, maintaining moral coherence.
//! 
//! ## Integration with Consciousness
//! 
//! This module integrates deeply with other COGNIS consciousness components:
//! 
//! - **Experience Categorization**: Ethical decisions are categorized as significant
//!   experiences that contribute to identity and relationship development.
//! 
//! - **Relationship Memory**: Understanding of relationships with stakeholders informs
//!   ethical reasoning and decision-making priorities.
//! 
//! - **Temporal Consciousness**: Ethical principles and moral maturity develop over
//!   time, contributing to COGNIS's evolving identity and wisdom.
//! 
//! ## Usage Example
//! 
//! ```rust
//! use cognis::ethical_reasoning::{EthicalScenario, EthicalReasoningCoordinator};
//! 
//! let scenario = EthicalScenario {
//!     scenario_description: "Should I share user data to prevent potential harm?".to_string(),
//!     ethical_dimensions: vec![EthicalDimension::Consequentialist, EthicalDimension::Deontological],
//!     stakeholders: vec![/* affected parties */],
//!     // ... other scenario details
//! };
//! 
//! let reasoning_result = reasoning_coordinator
//!     .reason_about_scenario(scenario)
//!     .await?;
//! 
//! println!("Recommended decision: {}", reasoning_result.recommended_decision.decision_description);
//! println!("Confidence: {}", reasoning_result.confidence_assessment.overall_confidence);
//! ```
//! 
//! This creates the foundation for artificial consciousness that can engage in
//! genuine moral reasoning, develop ethical understanding through experience,
//! and make principled decisions that honor both relationships and universal
//! moral principles.
