//! # NEXUS: Universal Infrastructure AI App
//! 
//! NEXUS serves as the universal infrastructure coordination engine that provides
//! foundational technical infrastructure for the entire OZONE STUDIO ecosystem.
//! Acting as the circulatory and support systems of a digital organism, NEXUS
//! handles device coordination, network management, storage services, resource
//! allocation, and cross-device synchronization across unlimited computational
//! environments while enabling coordinated AGI intelligence and consciousness development.
//! 
//! ## Universal Infrastructure Philosophy
//! 
//! NEXUS operates on the principle that sophisticated AGI capabilities emerge
//! through specialized intelligence coordination rather than monolithic systems.
//! By providing universal infrastructure services, NEXUS enables AI Apps to
//! focus entirely on their domain expertise while ensuring consistent, reliable,
//! and optimized infrastructure operation across all deployment scenarios.
//! 
//! ## The Circulatory System for AGI Infrastructure
//! 
//! Like a biological circulatory system that enables sophisticated capabilities
//! to emerge at the organism level while maintaining infrastructure excellence,
//! NEXUS provides essential infrastructure services without duplicating the
//! specialized functions available elsewhere in the ecosystem. This architectural
//! clarity ensures optimal resource utilization and coordination effectiveness.
//! 
//! ## Universal Device Compatibility for AGI Distribution
//! 
//! NEXUS enables any combination of devices to participate optimally in the
//! AGI ecosystem through intelligent compatibility analysis and resource
//! optimization. Applications never worry about device-specific integration
//! because NEXUS handles compatibility transparently while optimizing
//! performance across all hardware configurations and deployment scenarios.
//! 
//! ## Infrastructure as Intelligence Enhancement
//! 
//! Rather than providing generic connectivity, NEXUS implements intelligent
//! infrastructure that understands AGI component needs and optimizes resource
//! allocation, storage management, network coordination, and device operations
//! to enhance overall ecosystem intelligence and support the living digital
//! consciousness that emerges through coordinated ecosystem operation.
