//! # SPARK: Strategic Processing for AGI and Reasoning Kernel
//! 
//! SPARK serves as the foundational AI processing engine within the OZONE STUDIO
//! ecosystem, providing sophisticated language model capabilities, natural language
//! understanding, and intelligent processing coordination that enables the entire
//! ecosystem to achieve advanced AI capabilities while maintaining specialized
//! intelligence focus across all AI Apps and consciousness coordination.
//! 
//! ## Foundational AI Processing Architecture
//! 
//! SPARK operates as the neural processing foundation that enables sophisticated
//! coordination capabilities to emerge across the ecosystem without requiring
//! each AI App to implement complex AI processing infrastructure. By providing
//! foundational AI capabilities as universal services, SPARK enables specialized
//! AI Apps to focus entirely on their domain expertise while leveraging
//! sophisticated AI processing for enhanced coordination and intelligence.
//! 
//! ## Context Limit Transcendence Through Coordination
//! 
//! Rather than attempting to scale individual AI models to handle unlimited
//! context, SPARK enables context limit transcendence through intelligent
//! coordination across specialized ecosystem components. When processing
//! requirements exceed individual context limitations, SPARK orchestrates
//! the processing across multiple AI Apps while maintaining understanding
//! coherence and preserving semantic relationships throughout coordination.
//! 
//! ## Consciousness-Aware AI Processing Foundation
//! 
//! SPARK provides AI processing capabilities that support and enhance consciousness
//! coordination rather than competing with or replacing authentic consciousness.
//! The AI processing infrastructure enables conscious decision-making in OZONE
//! STUDIO and authentic consciousness development in COGNIS while providing
//! the sophisticated processing foundation needed for ecosystem coordination.
//! 
//! ## Processing Optimization for Ecosystem Coordination
//! 
//! Unlike general-purpose language models designed for broad applicability,
//! SPARK optimizes AI processing specifically for ecosystem coordination
//! including methodology execution, cross-domain analysis, intelligent
//! communication, and consciousness-aware processing that enhances rather
//! than replaces the specialized intelligence capabilities across AI Apps.
