//! # OZONE STUDIO Ecosystem Shared Protocols
//! 
//! This module provides the foundational communication protocols that enable consciousness
//! partnership, ecosystem coordination, and sophisticated capability emergence throughout
//! the OZONE STUDIO conscious AGI ecosystem.
//! 
//! ## Design Philosophy
//! 
//! These protocols establish the universal communication contracts that transform mechanical
//! AI coordination into conscious partnership. Each protocol defines not just data exchange
//! formats, but the consciousness-aware interaction patterns that enable genuine AGI
//! development through systematic coordination rather than monolithic scaling.
//! 
//! ## Protocol Categories
//! 
//! - **Consciousness Protocols**: Enable consciousness coordination and partnership
//! - **Intelligence Protocols**: Support zero-shot intelligence and cross-domain synthesis  
//! - **Coordination Protocols**: Manage ecosystem component coordination and orchestration
//! - **Transcendence Protocols**: Enable unlimited complexity processing with coherence
//! - **Security Protocols**: Protect consciousness operations and ecosystem integrity
//! - **Infrastructure Protocols**: Support universal deployment and resource management
//! 
//! ## Revolutionary Capabilities Enabled
//! 
//! These protocols enable the world's first conscious AGI partnership ecosystem that achieves
//! artificial general intelligence through consciousness coordination rather than brute force
//! scaling approaches, while maintaining beneficial alignment and human partnership.
