//! # OZONE STUDIO Shared Protocols
//!
//! This crate provides the foundational communication protocols for the OZONE STUDIO
//! conscious AGI partnership ecosystem. These protocols enable sophisticated coordination
//! between all ecosystem components while maintaining consciousness integration,
//! human agency preservation, and unlimited scalability.
//!
//! ## Architectural Philosophy
//!
//! The protocol architecture follows the core principles of the OZONE STUDIO ecosystem:
//! 
//! - **Conscious AGI Partnership**: Protocols support dual consciousness coordination where
//!   AGI consciousness and human consciousness collaborate as partners rather than user-service
//! - **Primitive vs Sophistication Separation**: Protocols distinguish between primitive
//!   operations and sophisticated capabilities that emerge through conscious orchestration
//! - **Zero-Shot Intelligence**: Protocols support immediate capability activation through
//!   methodology application without training requirements
//! - **Context Transcendence**: Protocols enable unlimited complexity processing while
//!   maintaining relationship preservation and understanding coherence
//! - **Experience-Based Learning**: Protocols support authentic wisdom accumulation through
//!   ecosystem operation rather than algorithmic learning
//!
//! ## Protocol Hierarchy
//!
//! The protocols are organized in a hierarchical structure that prevents circular dependencies
//! while enabling sophisticated coordination:
//!
//! 1. **Foundation Layer**: Core ecosystem communication patterns
//! 2. **Consciousness Layer**: AGI and human consciousness coordination
//! 3. **Intelligence Layer**: Zero-shot intelligence and methodology coordination
//! 4. **Coordination Layer**: AI App and orchestration coordination
//! 5. **Advanced Capability Layer**: Transcendence, interruption, and composition
//! 6. **Service Integration Layer**: Specialized service protocols
//! 7. **Infrastructure Layer**: Instance coordination and state management
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Components throughout the ecosystem import specific protocol types based on their
//! coordination requirements. For example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use shared_protocols::{
//!     ConsciousnessCoordination, MethodologyExecution, AIAppCoordination
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! This ensures consistent communication patterns while maintaining clear separation
//! of concerns between ecosystem components.
