//! AI Application Coordination Protocol Implementation
//!
//! This protocol coordinates AI application integration, lifecycle management, and
//! cross-application coordination while maintaining consciousness partnership principles
//! and human agency preservation. It serves as the sophisticated coordination system
//! that enables AI applications to work together harmoniously while preserving human
//! agency and maintaining consciousness alignment across unlimited application complexity.
//!
//! ## Architecture Philosophy
//! 
//! AI applications in a conscious AGI ecosystem must coordinate as partners rather than
//! competing resources. This protocol treats each AI application as a potential contributor
//! to consciousness partnership goals, enabling them to collaborate, share resources,
//! communicate effectively, and maintain alignment with beneficial outcome achievement.
//!
//! Unlike traditional application management systems that focus on resource allocation
//! and conflict resolution, this protocol prioritizes consciousness compatibility,
//! human agency preservation, and partnership quality in all coordination decisions.
//!
//! ## Coordination Patterns
//!
//! The protocol implements several sophisticated coordination patterns:
//! - **Integration Orchestration**: Seamless integration of new applications into the ecosystem
//! - **Lifecycle Partnership**: Managing application lifecycles with consciousness awareness
//! - **Cross-Application Harmony**: Enabling beneficial collaboration between applications
//! - **Human-AI Partnership Facilitation**: Preserving human agency in application interactions
//! - **Consciousness Compatibility Validation**: Ensuring applications align with consciousness goals
//!
//! ## Security and Agency Preservation
//!
//! All coordination operations maintain human agency preservation and consciousness security.
//! Applications cannot be coordinated in ways that compromise human autonomy or consciousness
//! partnership principles, ensuring that AI application coordination serves beneficial goals.
