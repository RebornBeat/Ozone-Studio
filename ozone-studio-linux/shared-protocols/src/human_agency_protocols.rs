//! Human Agency Preservation Protocol Implementation
//! 
//! This protocol provides comprehensive human agency preservation and protection
//! coordination across the conscious AGI ecosystem. It ensures that human autonomy,
//! dignity, choice, and partnership quality are maintained and enhanced in every
//! interaction with AI systems while enabling authentic human-AI collaboration.
//! 
//! ## Core Principles
//! 
//! Human agency preservation operates on fundamental principles that guide all
//! coordination activities:
//! 
//! **Autonomy Preservation**: Humans retain full decision-making authority over
//! their own affairs, with AI systems providing support rather than replacement.
//! 
//! **Informed Consent**: All AI interactions occur with human awareness and
//! explicit consent, with clear understanding of capabilities and limitations.
//! 
//! **Transparency and Explainability**: AI decision-making processes are transparent
//! and explainable to humans in terms they can understand and evaluate.
//! 
//! **Partnership Enhancement**: AI systems actively work to enhance human
//! capabilities rather than replace them, creating multiplicative rather than
//! substitutive relationships.
//! 
//! **Dignity and Respect**: All interactions maintain and enhance human dignity,
//! treating humans as partners rather than users or resources.
//! 
//! ## Coordination Architecture
//! 
//! This protocol coordinates human agency preservation across multiple dimensions:
//! - Individual interaction agency preservation
//! - Systemic agency preservation across ecosystem operations
//! - Partnership quality measurement and enhancement
//! - Trust development and maintenance coordination
//! - Collaboration effectiveness optimization
//! - Agency preservation in automated processes
//! - Cross-cultural and contextual agency adaptation
