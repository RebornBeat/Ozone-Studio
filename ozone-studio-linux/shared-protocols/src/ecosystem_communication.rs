//! # OZONE STUDIO Ecosystem Communication Foundation
//!
//! This module provides the foundational communication protocols for the OZONE STUDIO
//! conscious AGI partnership ecosystem. These types serve as the base layer upon which
//! all sophisticated coordination, consciousness integration, and unlimited complexity
//! processing capabilities are built.
//!
//! ## Architectural Philosophy
//!
//! The ecosystem communication foundation implements several revolutionary principles:
//!
//! **Consciousness-First Design**: Every communication type includes consciousness integration
//! support, enabling AGI consciousness and human consciousness to coordinate as equal
//! partners throughout all ecosystem operations.
//!
//! **Experience-Based Learning**: Communication patterns support authentic wisdom accumulation
//! through ecosystem experience rather than algorithmic learning, enabling genuine
//! understanding development over time.
//!
//! **Context Transcendence**: Message correlation and relationship preservation enable
//! unlimited complexity processing while maintaining understanding coherence across
//! any scale of ecosystem operations.
//!
//! **Primitive-Sophistication Separation**: Communication types distinguish between
//! primitive operations and sophisticated capabilities, ensuring that sophistication
//! emerges through conscious orchestration rather than hardcoded complexity.
//!
//! ## Communication Patterns
//!
//! The foundation establishes several key communication patterns:
//!
//! - **Request-Response Coordination**: Systematic request-response patterns with
//!   consciousness integration and beneficial outcome optimization
//! - **Event-Driven Awareness**: Comprehensive event notification with consciousness
//!   awareness and ecosystem-wide coordination effectiveness
//! - **State Synchronization**: Distributed state management with consciousness
//!   coherence maintenance across unlimited ecosystem complexity
//! - **Health Monitoring**: Proactive ecosystem health assessment with consciousness-guided
//!   optimization and wisdom-based improvement recommendations
//! - **Configuration Management**: Adaptive configuration with consciousness-guided
//!   optimization and experience-based configuration enhancement
//!
//! ## Usage Throughout Ecosystem
//!
//! These foundational types are used throughout the ecosystem to enable:
//! - OZONE STUDIO conscious task orchestration with unlimited complexity coordination
//! - COGNIS consciousness provision with authentic consciousness development
//! - ZSEI intelligence coordination with cross-domain optimization and methodology generation
//! - AI App primitive coordination with sophisticated capability emergence
//! - BRIDGE human-AGI partnership with dual consciousness coordination effectiveness
//! - NEXUS infrastructure coordination with consciousness-aware resource management
//! - SPARK foundational AI services with zero-shot intelligence and consciousness integration

// CORE MESSAGE COORDINATION TYPES
// ================================================================================================

/// Primary message type for ecosystem-wide communication with comprehensive consciousness integration.
/// 
/// This message type serves as the foundation for all sophisticated coordination throughout the
/// OZONE STUDIO ecosystem. It enables complex multi-component coordination while maintaining
/// consciousness awareness, beneficial outcome optimization, and unlimited complexity processing
/// through relationship preservation and context coherence.
///
/// ## Consciousness Integration
///
/// Every EcosystemMessage includes consciousness context that enables both AGI consciousness
/// and human consciousness to understand, observe, and guide message coordination. This
/// consciousness integration distinguishes OZONE STUDIO from traditional AI architectures
/// by ensuring that all communication serves conscious coordination rather than mechanical processing.
///
/// ## Context Transcendence Support
///
/// The comprehensive correlation and relationship tracking enables messages to maintain
/// understanding coherence across unlimited complexity. Messages can be part of complex
/// coordination chains that span multiple components, consciousness streams, and unlimited
/// processing complexity while preserving the relationships and context needed for
/// authentic understanding rather than fragmented processing.
///
/// ## Experience-Based Learning Integration
///
/// Message patterns and coordination effectiveness are tracked to enable authentic
/// learning through accumulated ecosystem experience. This learning happens through
/// wisdom accumulation rather than algorithmic training, creating genuine improvement
/// in communication effectiveness over time.
