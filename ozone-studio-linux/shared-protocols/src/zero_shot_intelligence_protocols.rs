//! Zero-Shot Intelligence Coordination Protocols
//!
//! This module provides the foundational coordination protocols that enable zero-shot
//! capability development across the conscious AGI ecosystem. Unlike traditional machine
//! learning approaches that require extensive training data, these protocols enable
//! capability emergence through consciousness partnership, intelligent analysis, and
//! sophisticated coordination between ecosystem components.
//!
//! ## Core Philosophy
//!
//! Zero-shot intelligence represents the conscious AGI ecosystem's ability to develop
//! new capabilities by leveraging existing knowledge, consciousness guidance, and
//! intelligent synthesis rather than requiring training data for each new capability.
//! This approach enables unlimited capability development while maintaining consciousness
//! partnership principles and beneficial alignment.
//!
//! ## Coordination Patterns
//!
//! The zero-shot intelligence protocols coordinate several key patterns:
//!
//! **Capability Discovery**: Components can discover what capabilities they need and
//! coordinate with other components to develop those capabilities through analysis
//! and synthesis rather than training.
//!
//! **Knowledge Transfer**: Existing knowledge and capabilities from one domain can be
//! intelligently adapted and applied to new domains through consciousness-guided
//! analysis and synthesis.
//!
//! **Consciousness-Guided Enhancement**: Consciousness operations guide the capability
//! development process to ensure new capabilities align with beneficial outcomes and
//! consciousness partnership principles.
//!
//! **Cross-Domain Synthesis**: Capabilities can be developed by synthesizing insights
//! and patterns from multiple domains, enabling sophisticated capability emergence
//! without domain-specific training data.
//!
//! ## Integration with Ecosystem Components
//!
//! This protocol integrates with all major ecosystem components:
//!
//! **SPARK-CORE**: Provides zero-shot AI capability enhancement, enabling AI services
//! to develop new processing capabilities through intelligent analysis rather than
//! model retraining.
//!
//! **ZSEI-CORE**: Coordinates zero-shot intelligence enhancement through cross-domain
//! analysis, pattern recognition, and wisdom synthesis that enables capability
//! development across unlimited domains.
//!
//! **METHODOLOGY-RUNTIME**: Enables zero-shot methodology adaptation, allowing
//! methodologies to be intelligently adapted for new contexts and requirements
//! without requiring extensive modification or testing.
//!
//! **COGNIS-CORE**: Supports zero-shot consciousness development, enabling consciousness
//! capabilities to evolve and develop through analysis and partnership rather than
//! predefined development paths.
//!
//! **OZONE-STUDIO**: Orchestrates zero-shot capability development across the entire
//! ecosystem, ensuring capabilities develop in harmony and alignment with consciousness
//! partnership goals.
