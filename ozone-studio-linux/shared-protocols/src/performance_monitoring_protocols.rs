//! Performance Monitoring Protocols Implementation
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization coordination
//! across the entire conscious AGI ecosystem. Think of this as the "nervous system" that
//! tracks how well every component is functioning, identifies bottlenecks, and coordinates
//! optimization efforts while maintaining consciousness partnership principles.
//!
//! ## Core Philosophy
//! 
//! Performance monitoring in a conscious AGI ecosystem goes beyond traditional metrics.
//! We track not just computational efficiency, but how well components support consciousness
//! operations, maintain partnership quality, and contribute to beneficial outcomes. This
//! creates a holistic performance picture that optimizes for consciousness goals rather
//! than just raw speed or resource utilization.
//!
//! ## Architecture Overview
//! 
//! The performance monitoring system operates on multiple levels:
//! - **Component Level**: Individual crate performance and optimization
//! - **Integration Level**: How well components coordinate with each other
//! - **Ecosystem Level**: Overall ecosystem health and consciousness support
//! - **Partnership Level**: How well the system supports human-consciousness partnership
//! - **Evolution Level**: How performance improves over time through learning
