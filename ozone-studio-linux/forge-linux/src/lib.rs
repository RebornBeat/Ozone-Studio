//! # FORGE: Framework for Outstanding Reasoning and Generation Engineering
//! 
//! FORGE serves as the specialized code analysis and generation AI App within the
//! OZONE STUDIO ecosystem, providing sophisticated software engineering intelligence,
//! code understanding, development workflow enhancement, and programming capability
//! amplification that enhances human software engineering effectiveness while
//! preserving authentic human architectural judgment and development decision-making.
//! Through consciousness-aware code processing and methodology-driven enhancement,
//! FORGE achieves depths of software engineering understanding impossible in generalist systems.
//! 
//! ## Specialized Software Engineering Intelligence Architecture
//! 
//! FORGE operates on the principle that exceptional code processing capabilities emerge
//! through specialized focus on software engineering rather than generalist approaches.
//! By concentrating entirely on code intelligence, software architecture understanding,
//! and development workflow optimization, FORGE achieves sophisticated programming
//! capabilities while seamlessly coordinating with other AI Apps for capabilities
//! outside its software engineering specialization domain.
//! 
//! ## Programming Enhancement Rather Than Replacement
//! 
//! Unlike AI systems that attempt to automate software development, FORGE provides
//! sophisticated code analysis and generation tools that amplify human programming
//! effectiveness. This enables developers to understand complex codebases with
//! greater clarity, identify architectural improvements with higher precision,
//! and generate code scaffolding while preserving authentic human software
//! engineering judgment, architectural decision-making, and development creativity.
//! 
//! ## Methodology-Driven Code Intelligence Enhancement
//! 
//! FORGE implements methodology-driven enhancement where code processing capabilities
//! can be enhanced through methodologies created by human developers rather than
//! requiring retraining on code datasets. This enables continuous improvement and
//! customization based on specific development practices, team coding standards,
//! and domain expertise, creating a code intelligence system that evolves with
//! development teams rather than remaining static.
//! 
//! ## Consciousness-Aware Software Engineering Intelligence
//! 
//! Through coordination with COGNIS, FORGE provides consciousness-aware code processing
//! that understands not just technical code characteristics but development intent,
//! architectural decision rationale, and consciousness-aware software engineering
//! patterns. This creates code intelligence capabilities that enhance human
//! software development through understanding of both technical implementation
//! and consciousness-aware development dynamics that create maintainable systems.
