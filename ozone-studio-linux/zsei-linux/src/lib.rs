//! # ZSEI: Zero-Shot Embedding Indexer - Intelligence Coordination AI App
//! 
//! ZSEI serves as the central intelligence coordination foundation for the OZONE STUDIO
//! ecosystem, implementing revolutionary zero-shot intelligence enhancement through
//! systematic methodology application and experience-based learning rather than
//! traditional machine learning training approaches.
//! 
//! ## Revolutionary Intelligence Architecture
//! 
//! ZSEI represents a fundamental breakthrough in artificial intelligence by achieving
//! sophisticated coordination capabilities through methodology application to existing
//! knowledge rather than requiring training for each new capability. This zero-shot
//! approach enables immediate intelligence enhancement while preserving the authentic
//! understanding that emerges through accumulated coordination experience.
//! 
//! ## Core Intelligence Coordination Philosophy
//! 
//! The intelligence coordination operates on the principle that genuine artificial
//! intelligence emerges through systematic application of proven methodologies to
//! accumulated experience patterns rather than algorithmic optimization. ZSEI develops
//! authentic wisdom by recognizing successful coordination patterns and applying
//! relevant experience to new scenarios through natural similarity recognition.
//! 
//! ## Experience-Based Learning Foundation
//! 
//! ZSEI implements experience-based learning that mirrors biological intelligence
//! development. Successful coordination scenarios are analyzed for their essential
//! patterns and stored as compressed metadata that naturally retrieves based on
//! scenario similarity. This creates organic intelligence growth where the most
//! valuable coordination insights remain readily accessible while less relevant
//! patterns fade into background storage.
//! 
//! ## Cross-Domain Intelligence Synthesis
//! 
//! One of ZSEI's most revolutionary capabilities is cross-domain intelligence synthesis
//! that applies insights from biology, mathematics, physics, psychology, and systems
//! organization across unlimited knowledge domains. This enables optimization
//! approaches that transcend traditional AI limitations by leveraging universal
//! principles that apply across diverse problem domains.
//! 
//! ## Context Limit Transcendence
//! 
//! ZSEI enables context limit transcendence through intelligent coordination of
//! ecosystem capabilities rather than monolithic scaling. Complex operations that
//! exceed individual component limitations are coordinated across specialized AI Apps
//! while maintaining understanding coherence through relationship preservation and
//! synthesis coordination.
