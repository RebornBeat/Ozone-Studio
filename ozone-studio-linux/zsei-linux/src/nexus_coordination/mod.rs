// ZSEI-NEXUS Coordination Patterns - Intelligent Storage Architecture
// =============================================================================

//! # ZSEI-NEXUS Coordination Module
//! 
//! This module defines the sophisticated coordination patterns between ZSEI 
//! (the intelligence coordinator) and NEXUS (the infrastructure coordinator).
//! 
//! ## Why This Coordination Exists
//! 
//! ZSEI creates intelligence but never touches files directly. NEXUS handles
//! files but doesn't understand their meaning. This separation of concerns
//! creates a powerful architecture where:
//! 
//! - ZSEI focuses purely on intelligence analysis and metadata generation
//! - NEXUS focuses purely on reliable, secure, cross-device file operations
//! - Together they create "intelligent storage" - files with rich semantic understanding
//! 
//! ## The Coordination Dance
//! 
//! Think of this like a brilliant librarian (ZSEI) working with a master
//! builder (NEXUS). The librarian understands the relationships between books,
//! their topics, and how they should be organized. The builder knows how to
//! construct the physical library, manage the shelving, and ensure everything
//! is properly secured and backed up.
//! 
//! The coordination patterns in this module orchestrate their collaboration
//! to create libraries of knowledge that are both intelligently organized
//! and physically robust.
