// Cross-Domain Intelligence Coordination - Universal Principle Discovery Engine
// 
// This module represents ZSEI's most revolutionary capability: the ability to analyze

// engineering, etc.) and discover universal principles that can be applied to enhance
// capabilities in completely different domains.
//
// Think of this as ZSEI's "universal translator" for knowledge itself - finding that
// principles like efficiency, resilience, adaptation, and optimization appear across
// all domains but are expressed through different mechanisms in each field.
