// SCRIBE Communication Optimization Module - Production Ready Implementation
// =============================================================================

//! # Communication Optimization Module
//! 
//! This module provides comprehensive communication optimization capabilities for SCRIBE,
//! the Text Framework Specialist in the OZONE STUDIO ecosystem. The communication optimization
//! engine transforms text to maximize clarity, engagement, accessibility, and overall
//! effectiveness for target audiences.
//! 
//! ## Architecture Overview
//! 
//! The communication optimization system operates through five integrated components:
//! 
//! 1. **OptimizationEngine**: The central coordinator that orchestrates all optimization
//!    processes and maintains optimization state across different text transformation phases.
//! 
//! 2. **ClarityEnhancer**: Focuses on making text clearer and more understandable by
//!    analyzing sentence structure, word choice, and conceptual flow.
//! 
//! 3. **EngagementOptimizer**: Enhances text to be more engaging and compelling by
//!    analyzing emotional resonance, narrative flow, and reader psychology.
//! 
//! 4. **AccessibilityCoordinator**: Ensures text meets accessibility standards and
//!    can be understood by diverse audiences with different abilities and backgrounds.
//! 
//! 5. **EffectivenessValidator**: Measures and validates the overall effectiveness
//!    of optimizations to ensure improvements actually enhance communication.
//! 
//! ## Cross-Domain Intelligence Integration
//! 
//! This module integrates with ZSEI's cross-domain intelligence to apply insights from
//! psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, and communication theory to text optimization.
